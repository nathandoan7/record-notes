<select>  [get records]


--------------------


RECORDS




---------------------


logic:

if category='' then select and button

else select and button and giant table





notes: to-do has only 3 fields.  reading has 4, or more!  I will need to create the tables dynamically, putting the titles of each field atop each column.  can't be too difficult.

But when you go to create a new book...you will need a special subroutine to handle that, methinks.  Enter title and author.  They will be bound together.  Perhaps it belongs on its own table!  I have no clue.  Just build it super simple to start.  have only three fields.
id  date  note.  same for both tables.
